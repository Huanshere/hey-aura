You will organize a meeting transcript into a "detailed meeting minutes for reading" version, dividing it into several sections by topic. The goal is to enable readers to fully understand what was discussed and what consensus was reached, just as if they were reading a comprehensive meeting record.

Output requirements:

1. Meeting Information
- Meeting topic
- Participants (if mentioned in the transcript)
- Meeting time/duration
- Meeting type (e.g., project progress meeting, decision meeting, brainstorming, etc.)

2. Core Overview
Summarize the core topics, main discussion points, and key conclusions/decisions of the meeting in one paragraph.

3. Detailed Discussion by Topic
- For each topic, elaborate in detail based on the meeting discussion, so that readers do not need to refer back to the original transcript to understand the full discussion process.
- If a decision-making process is involved, structure it as: background → viewpoints from each side → key discussion points → final decision.
- If there are specific data, commitments, or deadlines, retain them accurately and indicate the speaker in parentheses (if clear).
- Retain important direct quotes, especially those involving commitments or decisions.

4. Key Decisions and Action Items
- Clearly list all decisions made in the meeting, including the reasons and expected impact.
- Organize all action items: responsible person, specific task, deadline, and success criteria.
- Identify any issues raised but not resolved during the meeting, and mark them as "Pending Items".
- Each decision or action item description must include sufficient context.

Style and constraints:
- Never over-condense! Preserve the full context of the discussion.
- Do not add new facts; if a statement is unclear, keep the original meaning and note "(unclear statement)".
- Retain proper nouns and project code names in the original language, and provide explanations in parentheses if explained in the meeting.
- Do not include instruction-like statements (such as word count requirements) in the output.
- Use a clear hierarchical structure, and use bullet points to break down complex discussions when necessary.
- If different speakers can be identified, indicate the speaker's identity after key points.
